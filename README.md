# Approximato - Time Manager for Windows

Approximato is a time manager for those people who work better with a bit of elbow room in their workday. Strict adherence to the Pomodoro technique can be detrimental if you run out of focus time when you're within touching distance of completing a task. Or if you're in the flow for a task and would like to keep going on and postponing the break until later. Approximato keeps to the general on-off cycle of a Pomodoro, while allowing grace periods in between being focused and relaxed. This extra time is tracked separately from the focus period, and can be useful in estimating future tasks, or in identifying peak productivity times in a day.

## The Technique

The graphic below illustrates the steps that have to be executed for this technique.

## The Application

Approximato is a Windows Desktop implementation of this technique. It tracks the number of Pomodoros that have been completed, and the duration that the current Pomodoro has been active for. The number of Pomodoros can be configured by navigating into the Settings dialog box. In addition, it also has configurable values for the duration of a work session and the breaks in a Pomodoro.

Approximato accommodates those times when the user is on a creative streak or in the flow. It does so by being flexible about enforcing the end of a focus session. The overtime period is tracked separately from the focus period or its subsequent break. This leeway is useful for those times when the work spills over a bit from its allocated duration.

An alarm is triggered along with a visual notification when the work session is completed, and the application transitions to a break automatically. This can also be configured from the Settings dialog box. When the duration of the break is done, the application switches back into a work session.

A longer break (15 minutes by default) is triggered after the last work session is completed.

The application icon appears in the Notification Tray area at the bottom right.
