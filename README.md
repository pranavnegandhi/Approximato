## The Application

Tom is Windows Desktop implementation of this technique. It tracks the number of Pomodoros that have been completed, and the duration that the current Pomodoro has been active for. The number of Pomodoros can be configured by navigating into the Settings dialog box. In addition, it also has configurable values for the duration of a work session and the breaks in a Pomodoro.

An alarm is triggered along with a visual notification when the work session is completed, and the application transitions to a break automatically. This can also be configured from the Settings dialog box. When the duration of the break is done, the application switches back into a work session.

A longer break (15 minutes by default) is triggered after the last work session is completed.

The application icon appears in the Notification Tray area at the bottom right.
